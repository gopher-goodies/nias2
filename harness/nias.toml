# Memory Bus model
# "MEM | NATS" | "STAN" are alternatives depending on deployment type
#
# Use "MEM" for standalone low capacity machines and most Windows machines
# which have caps on tcp traffic
#
# Use NATS on capable machines and servers, and is preferred bus for Mac & Linux
# is also used as default bus for clustered installations
#
# Use STAN on same machines as NATS, but when persistent message streams are 
# required - i.e. clients may connect after work has completed
#
# Default build from NSIP is issued with "MEM" selected as majority of standalone
# users are on Windows. If  on Mac/Linux change to NATS for better performance.
#
# STAN streaming server is issued as sperate tool, please contact NSIP if required.
# Remember to set -cluster_id of streaming server to 'nias' if used.
